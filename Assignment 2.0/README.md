# Explaining the work done

Link to the website: [ctf](https://aca.pythonanywhere.com)


## The CTF

It is essentially divided into six parts. Each part having some learning associated with them.

1. Finding the way to get to the ctf by decoding a base64 string on index page.
2. Find the first flag from /ctf.
3. Second flag by getting the source code of /fast by curl or any GUI.
4. Third flag by /congratulate/\<variable\> route.
5. Find my cookie.
6. Next route by getting the post request correct.
7. Final route by finding out the robots.txt

> You are looking at the source code, you still need hints? :/


I also got to learn about submodules which is pretty cool!
