## Assignment 1.

#### Clientside
Anything that is displayed to the end user. This includes what the user sees, such as text, images, and the rest of the UI, along with any actions that an application performs within the user's browser.


#### Serverside
Anything happening on the web server is serverside. From complex calculations, to database handling line adding, deleting, etc.

#### HTTP Protocol
HTTP Protocol allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents, images, etc. It basically sets up rules to request to and from the web server.
